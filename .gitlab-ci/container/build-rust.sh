# When changing this file, you need to bump the following
# .gitlab-ci/image-tags.yml tags:
# DEBIAN_BUILD_BASE_TAG
# DEBIAN_TEST_BASE_TAG

# This version number should match what we require in meson.build so we catch
# build issues from patches relying on new features in newer Rust versions.
# Keep this is sync with the `rustc.version()` check in meson.build, and with
# the `rustup default` line in .gitlab-ci/meson/build.sh
MINIMUM_SUPPORTED_RUST_VERSION=1.82.0

# This version number can be bumped freely, to benefit from the latest
# diagnostics in CI `build-only` jobs, and for building external CI
# components.
LATEST_RUST_VERSION=1.90.0

# For rust in Mesa, we use rustup to install.  This lets us pick an arbitrary
# version of the compiler, rather than whatever the container's Debian comes
# with.
