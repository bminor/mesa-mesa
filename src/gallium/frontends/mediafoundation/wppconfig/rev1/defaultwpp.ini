#
# Default configuration options for tracewpp.
#
# This file provides configuration settings for tracewpp. By default, tracewpp
# uses "defaultwpp.ini" for configuration settings. An alternate INI file can
# be specified via the -defwpp parameter. Additional configuration settings can
# be specified via the -ini parameter or via "begin_wpp config" blocks in
# files specified via the -scan parameter.
#
# When parsing an INI file or a "begin_wpp config" block, tracewpp searches for
# syntax that looks like a function call, e.g. "FunctionName(arg1, ...);". For
# each function call, if the function name is one of the recognized commands
# described below (e.g. NOPREFIX, USEPREFIX, INCLUDE), that command is
# executed. Otherwise, the function call is treated as the definition of a
# trace function.

################################
# General configuration commands
################################
#
# FUNC FunctionName(ARG1, ARG2, MSG, ...);
# FUNC FunctionName{ARG1=value, ARG2=value}(ARG3, ARG4, MSG, ...);
#
#   Defines a trace function and its arguments. The tracewpp tool will scan all
#   source files for calls to the specified trace function. The generated TMH
#   file will then define the specified name as a macro and will generate code
#   to handle each call to the macro.
#
#   Function definitions are often prefixed by "FUNC", e.g.
#   "FUNC DoTraceMessage(LEVEL, MSG, ...);". The "FUNC" prefix is optional
#   but is helpful in drawing attention to function definitions.
#
#   Arguments provided in {braces} are defaulted parameters (sometimes called
#   "assumed arguments"). If you define a trace function
#   MyTrace{ARG1=5}(MSG, ...), then WPP will treat any use
#   of MyTrace("...", a, b) as if it were MyTrace(5, "...", a, b), and WPP will
#   generate macros for MyTrace that include an ARG1 parameter (for use by
#   user-specified expressions in the macro definition).
#
#   Note that when using TMF-based WPP, WPP will expect the user to define
#   ENABLED and LOGGER macros based on the arguments for defined functions.
#   For example, if you define a trace function
#   MyTrace(FLAG, MYARG, MSG, ...), WPP will expect user-defined macros
#   WPP_FLAG_MYARG_ENABLED(FLAG, MYARG) and WPP_FLAG_MYARG_LOGGER(FLAG, MYARG)
#   to be provided by the user. These user-supplied macros are usually defined
#   in terms of the corresponding WPP-supplied macros WPP_LEVEL_ENABLED(LEVEL)
#   and WPP_LEVEL_LOGGER(LEVEL).
#
#   Certain argument names trigger special behavior:
#   - "MSG" is the format string.
#   - "..." is a placeholder for the format string arguments. If present, it
#     must be the last argument.
#   - "PUBLIC_FILTER" marks the function as conditionally public. The function
#     will be public if the WPP_PUBLIC_<Flag> macro is defined when the file is
#     compiled (where <Flag> is the value of the PUBLIC_FILTER argument).
#
#   Certain argument names trigger special behavior in manifest-based WPP:
#   - "ControlGuid" specifies the name of the control GUID for the event. If
#     there is no ControlGuid argument, tracewpp will determine the control
#     GUID based on the event's level or keywords.
#   - "Level" specifies the level of the event. If there is no Level argument,
#     tracewpp will look for valid level names in all arguments of the event.
#     If no level name is found, the level will default to "win:Verbose".
#   - "Keywords" specifies the keywords (flags) of the event. If there is no
#     Keywords argument, tracewpp will look for valid keyword names in all
#     arguments of the event. If no keywords are found, the keyword will be
#     "win:AnyKeyword" (i.e. 0).
#   - "Name" specifies the event name.
#   - "Id" allows manual assignment of event Id and Version attributes. Syntax
#     is either "ID" or "IDvVERSION", e.g. "24" or "24v2". The specified Id
#     must be a number from 0..65535 that is outside of the auto-assignment
#     pool. Note that the auto-assignment pool defaults to 10..65535, so manual
#     assignment generally requires adjusting the auto-assignment pool (via the
#     TRACERANGE command).
#   - "Func" specifies the name of the event's call site function. Note that
#     when using manifest-based WPP, tracewpp is unable to automatically set
#     the event's function name during manifest generation. The function name
#     can be manually specified via the Func parameter or it can be included in
#     the event payload via DEFAULT_FUNC_NAME_IN_EVENT/USE_FUNC_NAME_IN_EVENT.
#
# NOPREFIX(FunctionName);
#
#   Removes the default trace message prefix "%!STDPREFIX!" for the specified
#   trace function.
#
# USEPREFIX(FunctionName, [Prefix, ArgNames...]);
# USESUFFIX(FunctionName, [Suffix, ArgNames...]);
#
#   Sets the trace message prefix or suffix for the specified trace function.
#   Each time WPP sees function("message", ...), it will add the specified
#   prefix or suffix to "message".
#
# PUBLIC_FILTER(FunctionName, Flag);
#
#   Marks the named function as conditionally public. The function will be
#   public if the WPP_PUBLIC_<Flag> macro is defined when the file is compiled.
#   Public functions omit certain metadata from the TMF such as filename and
#   line number. (Not applicable to manifest-based WPP.)
#
# INCLUDE(IniFileName);
#
#   Immediately processes the specified file as an INI file.
#
# PROCESSFILES(SourceFile...);
#
#   Processes the specified input file(s) as if they were specified on the
#   tracewpp command line. Example: PROCESSFILES("MyFile.cpp", "B*.c");
#
# SCANFORMACROS(HeaderFile...);
#
#   Scans the specified file(s) as if they were specified with
#   /scan:HeaderFile on the tracewpp command line.
#
# SEPARATE_TRACE_GUID_PER_FILE(Enabled);
#
#   If enabled (1), a new trace GUID will be generated for each input file
#   scanned. This is useful for TMF-based WPP, as it means changes in one
#   source file will not affect the trace GUID or event IDs of other source
#   files. This is undesirable for manifest-based WPP, as it requires a
#   large number of providers to be registered.
#
#   This is enabled (1) by default for TMF-based WPP. This is disabled (0) by
#   default for manifest-based WPP (when the /man parameter is specified).
#
# TRACERANGE(Min, Max);
#
#   Configures the range of numbers that WPP will use when automatically
#   assigning event IDs. Default is 10..65535. If manually assigning Ids, you
#   will need to reduce this range to reserve Ids for manual assignment, e.g.
#   use TRACERANGE(1000, 65535) so that Ids 1..999 can be manually assigned.
#
# WPP_FLAGS(Option...);
#
#   Processes the specified options as if they were specified on the tracewpp
#   command line. Example: WPP_FLAGS(noshrieks, p:MyProject);

################################
# Type definition commands
################################
#
# The following commands can be used to define data types for use with WPP
# trace functions. WPP type definitions may include the following settings:
#
# - Name: the WPP name of the type being defined. This name must be unique.
#   When reading the WPP format strings from source code, WPP matches the
#   requested type against this name. For example, "%d" will cause WPP to look
#   for a type named "d", and "%!HRESULT!" will cause WPP to look for a type
#   named "HRESULT".
# - EquivType: the name of the type in C or C++, e.g. "int". This type will be
#   used for the parameter of the inline helper function in the generated
#   code.
# - MofType: the MOF name of the type (shows up in the TMF file).
# - FormatSpec: the format string to use for this type in the message string.
#   For example, if FormatSpec is "I64x" then a message string might look like:
#   "Value = %10!I64x!".
# - Sig: the short name to use for this type when generating the names for
#   helper functions. Two different WPP types might use the same signature
#   because the types are compatible in terms of the helper functions (the
#   underlying C/C++ types are the same and the types serialize into ETW data
#   the same way).
# - Priority: the priority to give the type during argument sorting (only
#   significant when the /reorder parameter is used). This value is typically
#   set to the type's alignment so that more-aligned values sort first and
#   remain aligned within the ETW data.
# - ManifestType: describes the how the type should be treated in
#   manifest-based WPP. The ManifestType is a semicolon-separated list of type
#   parameters. The first parameter is required and specifies the winmeta input
#   type, e.g. "win:UInt32" (valid winmeta types are described in winmeta.xml).
#   Subsequent parameters specify options in the form of a name=value pair. The
#   supported options are:
#   - outType: Specifies the winmeta output type (i.e. a type formatting
#     qualifier), e.g. "xs:string". If not set, the type will not include an
#     outType attribute in the manifest and will receive default formatting by
#     the trace decoder. Example use of outType: win:Int32;outType=win:HResult
#   - adapter: Specifies a function or macro that should be applied to values
#     of this type before passing the value to the MC-generated EventWrite
#     macro. For example, if argument a10 has no adapter and argument a11 has
#     "ADAPT" as its adapter, the MC-generated EventWrite macro would be
#     invoked as EventWriteMyEvent(a10, ADAPT(a11)). The adapter might perform
#     a cast (e.g. cast ULONG_PTR to void*) or in the case of a Counted type
#     might convert a single value into a length+pointer pair. For example, the
#     adapter for a PUNICODE_STRING type might be the following macro:
#     #define ADAPT_PSTR(p) p->Length/2, p->Buffer
#     Example use of adapter: win:CountedUnicodeString;adapter=ADAPT_PSTR
#
# CUSTOM_TYPE(Name, BaseType(Extension), [FormatSpec]);
#
#   Creates a new type by adding an extension to an existing type. Typically
#   used to define enumerations, e.g.:
#   ItemListByte(EnumValues...), ItemListShort(EnumValues...),
#   ItemListLong(EnumValues...), ItemSetByte(EnumValues...),
#   ItemSetShort(EnumValues...), ItemSetLong(EnumValues...),
#   ItemEnum(EnumName), or ItemFlagsEnum(EnumName).
#
#   ItemList types are used for list enums, i.e. items counting up from 0.
#   ItemList types support skipping values via Value=number syntax.
#
#   ItemSet types are used for bitset enums, i.e. the first item has value
#   1, the second has value 2, the third has value 4, the fourth has value 8.
#
#   ItemEnum and ItemFlagsEnum types reference the name of a C/C++ enum and
#   are resolved using symbol information from the PDB. (ItemEnum and
#   ItemFlagsEnum do not work for manifest-based WPP because the PDB is not
#   used for resolving enumerations.)
#
# TYPEMACRO(Name, BaseType(Extension), [FormatSpec]);
#
#   Deprecated. Same as CUSTOM_TYPE.
#
# DEFINE_SIMPLE_TYPE(Name, EquivType, MofType, FormatSpec, Sig, Priority,
#                    [ManifestType]);
#
#   Creates a new fixed-length type that is passed to the helper function by
#   value (uses helper macro WPP_LOGTYPEVAL). Size in the event payload will
#   be sizeof(EquivType).
#
# DEFINE_SIMPLE_TYPE_PTR(Name, EquivType, MofType, FormatSpec, Sig, Priority,
#                        [ManifestType]);
#
#   Creates a new fixed-length type that is passed to the helper function by
#   address (uses helper macro WPP_LOGTYPEPTR). Size in the event payload will
#   be sizeof(*value).
#
# DEFINE_FLAVOR(Name, BaseType, [MofType, FormatSpec, ManifestType]);
#
#   Defines a new type that is based on another similar type, potentially
#   overriding the base type's MofType, FormatSpec, and manifest type. Omitted
#   or blank settings will remain the same as the base type.
#
# DEFINE_CPLX_TYPE(Name, MacroName, EquivType, MofType, FormatSpec, Sig,
#                  Priority, [ManifestType]);
#
#   Defines a complex type, i.e. one that requires special handling via a
#   helper macro other than WPP_LOGTYPEVAL or WPP_LOGTYPEPTR. Any type with a
#   variable length (e.g. any string type) is complex.
#
#   MacroName is the name of the helper macro that WPP should invoke when
#   passing this value to the helper function. The helper macro should itself
#   invoke the WPP_LOGPAIR macro with the data size and the data pointer. (Note
#   that helper macros are only used for TMF-based WPP, not for manifest-based
#   WPP.)

################################
# Manifest definition commands
################################
#
# The following commands are used with manifest-based WPP. Many of these
# commands accept a required Name, and allow for an optional Symbol. The item
# defined by such a command can be referenced by either its name or its
# symbol. If no symbol is defined, it can only be referenced by its name. The
# symbol may be useful in cases where the desired name is not a C/C++-friendly
# identifier.
#
# MANIFEST_CONFIGURATION(ManifestFile, [HeaderFile, Prefix]);
#
#   For use with manifest-based WPP. Normally specified via the command-line
#   -man option, not in an INI file or via configuration blocks.
#
# MANIFEST_RESOURCES(ResourceFile, [MessageFile, Culture]);
#
#   For use with manifest-based WPP. Specifies information about the installed
#   location of the DLL/EXE/SYS file that contains a manifest's resource data.
#   If not specified, Culture defaults to "en-us". Since the install location
#   is usually not known at build time, tracewpp defaults to using dummy paths
#   for the resource file and message file. The dummy paths are typically
#   overridden by the /rf and /mf parameters on the wevtutil command line
#   during manifest installation. Note that the ResourceFile and MessageFile
#   values must be absolute paths.
#
# DEFINE_CONTROL_GUID(Name, [Guid, Symbol]);
#
#   For use with manifest-based WPP. Defines a control GUID (aka a provider).
#   If the Guid parameter is not specified, the GUID for the provider will be
#   computed by hashing the Name using the same name hashing algorithm as is
#   used by tracelog, xperf, EventSource, and other ETW tools.
#
# DEFINE_BIT(Name, [Mask, Symbol]);
#
#   For use with manifest-based WPP. Adds a keyword to the most recently
#   defined control guid. The default mask of the keyword is the control
#   guid's lowest unused keyword bit.
#
#   Mask may be specified as decimal or hexadecimal and must be a power of 2.
#
# DEFINE_KEYWORD(Name, ControlGuidId, Mask, [Symbol]);
#
#   For use with manifest-based WPP. Defines a keyword associated with the
#   specified control GUID. Rarely used: DEFINE_BIT is usually simpler.
#
# DEFINE_LEVEL(Name, ControlGuidId, Value, [Symbol]);
#
#   For use with manifest-based WPP. Defines a level associated with the
#   specified control GUID. The level value must not conflict with any
#   built-in levels (level values 0 through 15 are built-in levels). Rarely
#   used: the built-in levels are sufficient for most components.
#
# DEFINE_BUILTIN_KEYWORD(Name, Mask, [Symbol, Symbol...]);
#
#   For use with manifest-based WPP. Normally used in the defaultwpp.ini file,
#   not in per-project INI files or configuration blocks. Defines a global
#   (Microsoft-defined) keyword value. These keywords can be used with any
#   control GUID. These keywords will not be defined in the manifest - they
#   are expected to match keyword definitions from winmeta.xml.
#
# DEFINE_BUILTIN_LEVEL(Name, Value, [Symbol, Symbol...]);
#
#   For use with manifest-based WPP. Normally used in the defaultwpp.ini file,
#   not in per-project INI files or configuration blocks. Defines a global
#   (Microsoft-defined) level value. These levels can be used with any control
#   GUID. These levels will not be defined in the manifest - they are expected
#   to match level definitions from winmeta.xml.
#
# DEFAULT_FUNC_NAME_IN_EVENT(Expression, [TypeName]);
#
#   For use with manifest-based WPP. When using manifest-based WPP, tracewpp is
#   unable to automatically set the event's function name during manifest
#   generation. The function name can be manually specified via the Func
#   parameter or it can be included in the event payload via
#   DEFAULT_FUNC_NAME_IN_EVENT or USE_FUNC_NAME_IN_EVENT.

#   The DEFAULT_FUNC_NAME_IN_EVENT command will add a hidden string property
#   named "!FUNC!" to every event (except when overridden by
#   USE_FUNC_NAME_IN_EVENT). The value of the property will be taken from the
#   specified Expression. The Expression will typically be set to
#   "__FUNCTION__". TypeName is the WPP name of the type to use for the hidden
#   argument. TypeName defaults to "hs" (i.e. nul-terminated char* string).
#
# USE_FUNC_NAME_IN_EVENT(FunctionName, Expression, [TypeName]);
#
#   For use with manifest-based WPP. When using manifest-based WPP, tracewpp is
#   unable to automatically set the event's function name during manifest
#   generation. The function name can be manually specified via the Func
#   parameter or it can be included in the event payload via
#   DEFAULT_FUNC_NAME_IN_EVENT or USE_FUNC_NAME_IN_EVENT.
#
#   The USE_FUNC_NAME_IN_EVENT command with a non-empty value for Expression
#   will add a hidden string property named "!FUNC!" to every event generated
#   by the specified trace function. The value of the property will be taken
#   from the specified Expression. The Expression will typically be set to
#   "__FUNCTION__". TypeName is the WPP name of the type to use for the hidden
#   argument. TypeName defaults to "hs" (i.e. nul-terminated char* string).
#
#   If Expression is empty (i.e. ""), the "!FUNC!" property will not be added
#   to events generated by the specified trace function. A blank Expression
#   can be used to override a default set by DEFAULT_FUNC_NAME_IN_EVENT.
#

################################
# Format string syntax
################################
#
# The format string is parsed to determine the type and format of event
# properties. Format string syntax is similar to printf, i.e. a '%' character
# not immediately followed by another '%' character will be treated as the
# start of a property reference.
#
# A property reference is parsed as one of the following:
#
# '%' [ '{' PropertyName '}' ] [Prefix] ShortTypeName
# '%' [ '{' PropertyName '}' ] [ArgNum] '!' [Prefix] LongTypeName '!'
#
# {PropertyName} is optional. If specified, the name must contain only
# identifier characters, i.e. a-z, 0-9, and '_'.
#
# Prefix includes flags ('-', '+', '#'), width digits, and/or '.' followed by
# precision digits. Note that prefix does not support "*" or ".*".
#
# If prefix is specified, it will be included in the event's format string
# along with the type's FormatSpec. For example, "%+02hX" would be parsed as
# Prefix="+02", ShortTypeName="hX". Type "hX" has FormatSpec="X", so the final
# WPP format string for the property would be "+02X".
#
# If the -NoShrieks command-line option is set and the prefix before a
# ShortTypeName contains only digits, tracewpp will treat the number as an
# ArgNum instead of a Width.
#
# The ArgNum before '!' is optional. It indicates the index of the argument to
# use for this property reference. If not specified, ArgNum is determined from
# the position of the property reference in the format string.
#
# By default, ShortTypeName is a length (one of "", "I", "I64", "h", "w", "l",
# or "ll") followed by a specifier (any single character). However, if the
# -NoShrieks command-line option is set, ShortTypeName is any number of
# identifier characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_') and ends at the first
# non-identifier character.
#
# LongTypeName is any non-empty sequence of characters ending at the '!'.
#
# ShortTypeName or LongTypeName must match the name of a defined WPP type (i.e.
# the type names defined below or your own custom types).
